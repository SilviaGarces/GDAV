Exercise 3: Comparative Genomics: Functional annotation resources
**Part1:**
Using Blastp:
Has the sequence any homolog?
In your opinion, would you say this is a known gene or a novel sequence?
Any hint on its function? Metabolic pathways?
Does the sequence have any known domain?
Does it look like a prokaryotic or eukaryotic sequence?
The sequence was observed in a dataset with only bacterial organisms.

How would you proceed to guess which is the closest organism having this sequence?
